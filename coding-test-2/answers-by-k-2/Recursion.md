#Recursion

It looks magical initially but its really based on logic. 

How it works: 

1. Identify a base case 
Which is the condition required to make the evaluation stop. 
In other words if it is true, then return the value and stop execution.

2. Use the base condition and repeat it for multiple values 
You repeat the same condition check by using the fucntion name and calling it with a lesser value of n

3. Behind the scenes the computer will check continously over multiple values if the base condtion is met 
and then return the sum or total results of that check. 

4. Probelms requiring recursion as a tool have one thing in common, and that is n keeps reducing.
